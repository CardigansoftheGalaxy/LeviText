# LeviText ðŸ•´

LeviText is a lightweight, portable, **always-on-top rich text editor** for Windows 10/11.  
It "levitates" above all other windows so your notes are always visible, accessible, and editable.

ðŸ•´ Inspired by the levitating man emoji â€” LeviText floats effortlessly, a nod to *Leviticus*, a ghostly presence that became part of our workplace culture.
